# CLAUDE.md

Read `CONSTITUTION.md` first; the estate's shared constitution arrives through the `helios`
plugin before it. This file is the working rules for HeliosSIP. Anything local to one machine lives
in the gitignored `CLAUDE.local.md`, never here: this file is public.

## Project

SIP-to-SSH gateway giving dial-up access to any SSH or Telnet host, for retro PBX networks. A caller with a modem and a VoIP line reaches a board the way they did in 1992. The gateway is an ordinary SSH or Telnet client to whatever it connects to; nothing Helios-specific crosses the wire. One developer, six repositories under the `HeliosBBS` organisation
developed together; developer time is the scarcest resource, so the tooling does the
breaking-down, the model does the building, and the developer reviews in feature terms.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | what is specific to this project; the shared principles come from the plugin |
| `features/` | feature briefs, one file per feature, developer-owned |
| `docs/spec/` | the derived corpus: `architecture.md` and one file per subsystem |
| `Makefile` | `make check` runs everything CI runs, once the first feature has chosen the stack |

The skills (`feature-brainstorm`, `feature-design`, `feature-plan`, `feature-build`,
`compound`) and the hooks come from the plugin; the issue form, labels and reusable workflows
from the estate's `.github` repository; the operational runbook and learnings live in this
repository's wiki, unreviewed and disposable by design.

## The stack

Not chosen yet. The first feature's design names it once, in `docs/spec/architecture.md`,
and adds the `Makefile` whose `check` target becomes the required check on `development`.
Until then there is nothing to build and CI runs nothing.

## Work tracking, routing, branches

As in the engine's `CLAUDE.md`, which is the reference: GitHub Issues through the issue form
and `work`; Sonnet 5 at high effort by default with route-up decided by code and review never
downgraded; `main` is the default branch and holds releases only, `development` takes pull
requests on green checks, work branches are `issue-<n>-<slug>` in their own worktree; the
unattended loop commits as the organisation's App, never as the developer.

## Mandatory rules

- Never commit a credential, key or token. Push protection is on.
- Hooks enforce the mechanical rules: `features/`, `CONSTITUTION.md` and the licence files
  are developer-owned; edits are formatted; a turn does not end on a red `make check`.
- An interface crossing a repository boundary is a protocol or a wire format, versioned in the
  contracts register, or it does not cross.
- Questions: one at a time. Pushback: with reasoning, never an echo.
- State assumptions before coding; minimum code that solves the problem; touch only what the
  request needs; four attempts per bug, then raise it; fail loud.

## Code style

Allman braces in every language except Go. Names readable without knowing abbreviations. A
comment is the exception and explains a why the code cannot show. Every permission check gets
a negative-path test. Never log a secret. Supported targets: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`,
`windows/amd64`.

new one is audited for licence compatibility.
